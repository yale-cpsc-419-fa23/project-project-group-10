# Lab Rats
A web application to connect Yale research labs and student participants. <br><br>
As many research trials offer compensation for participation, there is student demand for research trials. Currently, many departments recruit for their labs' trials via flyers, newsletters, or websites. However, each stream of communication only advertises their respective department's labs, and students who seek opportunities from different departments must subscribe to multiple streams. <u>Lab Rats hopes to centralize the process of seeking trial participation opportunities across Yale's vast departments in one website.</u><br><br>
The Lab Rats workflow offers two account types which are indicated upon registration: researcher and participant.

## Researcher
Researchers are able to:
<ul>
    <li>Post trials from their labs
    <li>Indicate what demographics they are seeking for in their participants, such as age range, sex, usage of alcohol or smoking, etc.
</ul>

## Participant
Participants are able to:
<ul>
    <li>Browse trial listings
    <li>Filter trial listings according to their demographics
    <li>Favorite and save trials they are interested in
</ul>

# Backend 
<strong>Members: Ariana Delgado and Jennifer Truong<br>
Implemented with Python, Flask, and SQLite</strong><br>
For backend, we created the tables for the program in order to be in scope with the information that we would expect to get from the program. After creating the database, we created the app.py file that would start up our flask program and the app routes. Once we had the frontend html files from the frontend group, we were able to link the frontend and backend aspects together in order to get the program fully running. In order to run our program, you also need to download flask and flask session. 


# Frontend 
<strong>Members: Jessica Le and Aly Moosa<br>
Implemented with React, JavaScript</strong><br>
For frontend, we first created a figma file to come up with color palettes, possible website layouts, and brainstorm user experience. Through this, we were able to help the backend to think about what tables and what information we will need. We experimented and researched different frontend approaches, but decided to save complex coding and page construction for our Alpha Version and still to HTML/Pure Javascript for the MVP. We constructed the frontend pages and sent over to the backend to merge our work together.
