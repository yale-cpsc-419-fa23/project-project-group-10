Frontend: Aly & Jessica
Frontend has completed all the react pages and their respective components. The participant pages include: login, register, homepage, profile, and search. The search page has general filters (+/- 18 and sex), as well as an advanced search. The widgets that will appear via search request have also been created and stylized, but have not yet been connected to the backend. The researcher pages include: login, register, homepage, posting form, and profile. On the homepage, the researcher is able to create a new study post and is redirected to a form that they can fill out regarding the information and details of their study. Additionally, we reorganized the structure of our templates to implement a specific participant and researcher navbar. Once connected with the backend, all the features and functionalities will be completed. 

To navigate from register or login to the actual participant pages, please manually input these tags into the search bar. From here you will be able to use the navbar to move from page to page.

Backend: Ariana & Jennifer
For the beta version, backend has finished the insertion of the data for all the features we needed to implement. This includes having a favorites feature to allow users to see the trials that have been posted and then adding them to their saved tab. We were able to expand on the trials page by making all of the trials clickable to display the full information on a trial. The user can then click the favorite button to add it to their saved. We currently have all of the functionality of our project implemented with the HTML files and simply need to establish the connection between the react frontend and our flask backend.
